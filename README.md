Green Water Footprint (GWF) Mini Project
This project is developed as part of the Mini Project on Open-Source Technologies for the Department of Computer Science and Applications at FYMCA, Division – A (A.Y 2024-2025). The project focuses on optimizing rainwater usage for agriculture in Pune's agricultural sector by calculating the Green Water Footprint (GWF) for various crops and soil types.

🚀 Problem Statement
Pune’s agricultural sector lacks a specialized tool to optimize rainwater usage (green water) effectively. This leads to water wastage and reduced crop yields. The aim is to develop a web application that calculates the Green Water Footprint (GWF) using data on:
* Rainfall
* Soil type
* Crop water requirements
* Water retention rates
The solution provides tailored insights to help farmers manage water resources sustainably.

📌 Project Scope
* A user-friendly web application for farmers and administrators to input data and calculate GWF.
* Real-time insights into rainwater utilization.
* Data-driven decision-making with accurate GWF calculations and reports.
* Integration of location-specific data (e.g., soil types, rainfall patterns) for precision.
* Historical tracking and comparison of water usage for improved agricultural practices.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Hardware Requirements:
* Processor: i5 or above
* RAM: 8GB or above
* Storage: SSD
Software Requirements:
* OS: Windows 7 or higher
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js, Bootstrap)
* Backend: Java (JDK 17+ with Spring Boot)
* Database: MySQL with JDBC
* API Layer: RESTful web services
